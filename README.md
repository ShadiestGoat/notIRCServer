# Not IRC Server

## What is this?

Not an IRC server, let me tell you that much...

This is a bare bones, absolute minimum 'educational' server for proxying messages between some clients. The idea is that multiple clients can login into this server, retrieve the last few messages, and chat. 

## Quality

This is made in like 30 minutes so don't expect quality or polish. This is not made for production at all. Its meant to interface with [the client](https://github.com/ShadiestGoat/notIRCClient)
